# housing-pull
Pulls 40 housing options with user inputted parameters and outputs details about each one to a .csv file. Useful because most homeless clients lack access to a computer so now case managers can simply hand them a printed out piece of paper. Currently only functional for Detroit, but functionality for other cities would be easy to add
